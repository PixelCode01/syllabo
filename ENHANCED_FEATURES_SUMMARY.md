# Enhanced Features Summary

## Addressing User Feedback

The user provided valuable feedback about missing functionality:

> "I can see that it's recommending resources. But it's not directly linking to any of them. I would expect it to link to a YouTube video or Playlist I can click and it takes me directly to that. Or saves them in a text file I can always reference. But from the demo — unless I'm really blind — it's doing none of that."
