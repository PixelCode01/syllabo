- Analyze learning patterns and behaviors

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### 1. Creating a Learning Profile

```python
# Interactive profile creation
await syllabo._interactive_ai_learning()
# Choose: create_profile

# Programmatic creation
assessment = {
    "learning_style": "visual",
    "difficulty_preference": 0.6,
    "study_pace": "normal",
    "attention_span": 45,
    "goals": ["Master Python", "Learn Data Science"]
}
profile = await ai_learning_engine.create_learning_profile(user_id, assessment)
```

### 2. Generating Adaptive Learning Paths

```python
# Generate path for Python programming
topics = ["Python Basics", "Data Types", "Functions", "OOP", "Advanced Concepts"]
path = await ai_learning_engine.generate_adaptive_learning_path(
    user_id, "Python Programming", topics
)

# Get next learning activity
activity = await ai_learning_engine.get_next_learning_activity(user_id, path_id)
