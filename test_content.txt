Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train models. Examples include classification and regression problems.

2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in data without labels. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with an environment using rewards and penalties.

Key concepts in machine learning include:
- Training data: The dataset used to teach the algorithm
- Features: Individual measurable properties of observed phenomena
- Model: The mathematical representation of a real-world process
- Algorithm: The method used to create the model

Popular machine learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines.
