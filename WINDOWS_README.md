# Syllabo for Windows

## Important Notice About Antivirus Software

**Windows Defender and other antivirus programs may flag this software as suspicious. This is a false positive.**

Syllabo is packaged using PyInstaller, which creates standalone executables. This packaging method often triggers false positives because the executable contains compressed Python code that unpacks at runtime.

### The software is completely safe because:
- It's open source - you can review all code on GitHub
- It doesn't modify system files or registry
- It only accesses the internet for educational content APIs
- No personal data is collected or transmitted

## Quick Solutions

### If Windows Defender blocks the file:

**Option 1: Add Exclusion (Recommended)**
1. Open Windows Security
2. Go to "Virus & threat protection"
3. Click "Manage settings" under protection settings
4. Scroll to "Exclusions" and click "Add or remove exclusions"
5. Click "Add an exclusion" â†’ "File"
6. Select the syllabo.exe file

**Option 2: Use the Safe Runner**
1. Double-click `run_syllabo_safe.bat`
2. Follow the on-screen instructions

## Installation Options
